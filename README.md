# ADS-B_Project_CD-10

This project by group CD-10 of the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), with guidance from Dr.ir. Joost Ellerbroek, aims to use
openly available ADS-B data to create representative usage statistics of the Dutch airspace and airports. These statistics are then meant
to be useful for open-source simulation projects such as BlueSky (http://homepage.tudelft.nl/7p97s/BlueSky/) by the C&O section of the 
TU Delft.

In this repository all the Python code that we used to create the statistics can be found, so you should be able to input your own ADS-B 
data to create your own statistics. A report which contains our statistics and findings can also be found on this repository. 

For any questions, you can email N.J.vanAmstel@student.tudelft.nl.
